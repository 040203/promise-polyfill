promise-light
=============

Light weight promise implementation for the browser. (A+ Compliant) . It is a perfect polyfill for Chrome/Firefox built-in promises.


This implementation is based on [then/promise](https://github.com/then/promise). It has been changed to use the prototype for performance and memory reasons.
